# **SQL Challenge**
---
## Just a few queries on archived employment data from Pewlett Hackard using PostgreSQL
###  1. First I brought in the data and created an Entity Relationship Diagram using PG Admin 

![This was super easy!](Employee_DB_ERD.pgerd.png)

###  2. Schema script was created in PG Admin and can be found in the 'PG_Scripts' folder.
###  3. Query scripts can also be found in that folder.
